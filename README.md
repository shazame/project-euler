project-euler
=============

This repository contains solutions to some problems of the Project Euler (see http://projecteuler.net/)

Solved problem can be found in the _solved_ directory.

I started to create a lib in order to help me to solve some problems more efficiently.
Currently this lib provides only prime numbers helpers and can be found in the
folder _eulib_

Various tools can also be found in the _tools_ folder. The tools can be
useful for some problems.
`convert` can be used to create the header of a C/C++ file from the text
describing the problem.
